# Security System Application

This Security System Application is a basic user authentication program written in C++. It provides three main functionalities: user registration, login, and password change, ensuring secure access to the system. The program stores user credentials in a text file and verifies the user input during login and password modification. It's ideal for educational purposes or small-scale applications requiring a simple authentication mechanism.


## Tech Stack

* C++: Core programming language used for implementation.
* File Handling: User data is stored and retrieved using basic file handling ```(fstream)```.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

C++ compiler (GCC, Visual Studio, or any preferred IDE)

**1. Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Jinendra-Gambhir/Security-System.git
```

**2 Navigate to the project directory:**

```
cd Security-System
```

**3. Compile the C++ file:**

```

## Project Steps

**1. Register:**

Users can create an account by entering a username, password, and age. This information is stored in a text file.

**2. Login:**

Existing users can log in using their username and password. The system verifies the credentials against the stored data.

**3. Change Password:**

Users can update their password by providing the old password and confirming the new one.
## Features

- Registration: Store and manage user data.
- Login: Authenticate existing users with secure credential verification.
- Password Change: Allow users to update their password.
